JSMin4Assetic
-------------

Slight modified version of [nick4fake/JsMin](https://github.com/nick4fake/JsMin/) that works with [Assetic](https://github.com/kriswallsmith/assetic).

The fastest solution to use JsMin and Assetic if you use [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/).


Installation
============

Add the following lines to your `composer.json`

``` javascript
{
    "require": {
        "lmammino/jsmin4assetic": "1.0.*"
    }
}
```

and run 

`> php composer.phar update`

or

`> composer update`
(if you installed composer globally)
